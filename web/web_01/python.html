Convert the characters &, < and > in string s
to HTML-safe sequences.
Use this if you need to display text that might contain
such characters in HTML.
If the optional flag quote is true, the characters (")
and (') are also translated;
this helps for inclusion in an HTML attribute
value delimited by quotes, as in
</body>
